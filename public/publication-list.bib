abstract={To understand the observational properties of cosmological models, in particular, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, it is necessary to study their null geodesics. Dynamical systems theory, in conjunction with the orthonormal frame approach, has proved to be an invaluable tool for analyzing spatially homogeneous cosmologies. It is thus natural to use such techniques to study the geodesics of these models. We therefore augment the Einstein field equations with the geodesic equations, all written in dimensionless form, obtaining an extended system of first-order ordinary differential equations that simultaneously describes the evolution of the gravitational field and the behavior of the associated geodesics. It is shown that the extended system is a powerful tool for investigating the effect of space-time anisotropies on the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, and that it can also be used for studying geodesic chaos.},

 Using this approach, we obtain a clear picture of the full phase space and the full space of solutions.

We also discuss the various `band structures' that are associated with certain one-parameter sets of solutions.}

The systems are analyzed numerically and qualitatively, using the theory of dynamical systems. Certain key solutions are shown to form building blocks which, to a large extent, determine the remaining solution structure. In one formulation, there exists a monotone function that forces the general relativistic solutions towards a part of the boundary of the state space that corresponds to the low pressure limit. The solutions on this boundary describe Newtonian models and thus the relationship to the Newtonian solution space is clearly displayed. It is numerically demonstrated that general relativistic models have finite radii when the polytropic index n satisfies 0⩽n≲3.339 and infinite radii when n⩾5. When 3.339≲n<5, there exists a 1-parameter set of models with finite radii and a finite number, depending on n, with infinite radii.}

The late time dynamics of the VII0 perfect fluid models, and in particular that of the radiation fluid, is a prime example of the complexity inherent in the field equations of general relativity.}

abstract = {In this Letter we will show that, contrary to what is widely believed, an almost isotropic cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature does not imply that the universe is "close to a Friedmann-Lemaitre universe." There are two important manifestations of anisotropy in the geometry of the universe: (1) the anisotropy in the overall expansion, and (2) the intrinsic anisotropy of the gravitational field, described by the Weyl curvature tensor; the former usually receives more attention than the latter in the astrophysical literature. Here we consider a class of spatially homogeneous models for which the anisotropy of the CMB temperature is within the current observational limits but whose Weyl curvature is not negligible, i.e., these models are not close to isotropy even though the CMB temperature is almost isotropic.}

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to further investigate the solution space of self-similar spherically symmetric perfect-fluid models and gain a deeper understanding of the physical aspects of these solutions. We achieve this by combining the state space description of the homothetic approach with the use of the physically interesting quantities arising in the comoving approach. We focus on three types of models. First, we consider models that are natural inhomogeneous generalizations of the Friedmann universe; such models are asymptotically Friedmann in their past and evolve fluctuations in the energy density at later times. Secondly, we consider so-called quasi-static models. This class includes models that undergo self-similar gravitational collapse and is important for studying the formation of naked singularities. If naked singularities do form, they have profound implications for the predictability of general relativity as a theory. Thirdly, we consider a new class of asymptotically Minkowski self-similar spacetimes, emphasizing that some of them are associated with the self-similar solutions associated with the critical behaviour observed in recent gravitational collapse calculations.}
